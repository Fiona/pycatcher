Little program for generating images used in timelapse videos. (Videos made up of frames taken over long periods of time distilling a lot of footage down to a short timeframe.)
PyCatcher starts with a grab of your screen and runs it through predefined filters, before saving the resulting image out and waiting for the next time it should run.
It supports taking webcam images and having them showing in a small box inline.

Dependencies:
-PIL
-PyGTK

Webcam support dependencies:
-OpenCV + Python bindings
